# import-sf-mono

[New San Francisco Monospaced font is gorgeous!](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/4o23fm/new_san_francisco_monospaced_font_is_gorgeous/) Unfortunately, it’s only available inside `Terminal.app` (and `Xcode.app`).

This Atom package imports the “SF Mono” font directly from `Terminal.app`, which allows you to use this font in Atom.

__Usage:__

1. Get a Mac and install Mac OS X Sierra or higher.

2. Install this Atom package.

3. Configure your font in Atom to "SF Mono".

4. Gorgeous.

__Note:__ This package does not contain the font files. It only references the font files located in your system. The full package source code is available [here](styles/import-sf-mono.less).
